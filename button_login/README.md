# one button login

one button tty login, all this does is send username *Enter* password *Enter* on button press, which is enough to quickly login to tty. this is pretty useless as you can configure login without pass anyway, and it'd compromise what little security you had. but I already made this when messing with getting usb keyboard working so it's going to stay here now.
